			<h2>Introduction:</h2>
			<p>This process book describes my team’s solution to our Info 360 course’s assignment. This assignment asked us to first find a solvable design problem on surviving college. As a result our team decided to tackle the problem of the student’s lack of knowledge of healthy dish recipes. <br><br>

			This book describes our group’s efforts to solve this problem. We will go in-depth on our dynamics, responsibilities and the actions that we took. My partners were Jenny Chen and Wesley Wolanski. <br><br>

			The very first thing that this process book will talk about is our group’s first meeting. It will go into depth on our first conversations about out design problem. <br><br>

			<h2>First Meeting:</h2>
			<p>We were given the task of finding a design problem under the context of surviving college in class. This was also during the time where we first met each other. While there was a little awkwardness, we worked together to find a problem. <br><br>

			We were brainstorming at a fast rate. I started throwing out ideas that college students typically face here. We said problems like money issues, time management, and meeting new people. Just when we tried to delve more deeply into these issues, our team brainstormed the issue of the freshmen 15. <br><br>

			The freshmen 15 is a real problem that all of us saw or experienced. I lived in the dorms my freshmen year and saw it in person. We realized that the reason was that freshmen gain weight because they don’t know how to cook thus eats out constantly. <br><br>

			We were excited about this problem, and decided to go with this. As a result, at the end of our first meeting we decided to use unhealthy eating habits as our design problem.

			<h2>Brainstorming: Sticky Notes</h2>
			<p>In lab we were given the task of brainstorming possible solutions to this design problem. Our design problem was the unhealthy eating habits of students. These solutions were put on sticky notes. <br><br>

			We brainstormed ideas such as songs on healthy information, news regarding nutrition, picture book of healthy dishes, history of what we ate, and a multitude of other ideas. <br><br>

			After I wrote down all of our group’s ideas on the post it notes, we grouped them together. The organization of this was in terms of what ideas we thought were best. <br><br>

			At this point, I began to think that this was a huge problem. I felt a little overwhelmed and wanted more information so that we can have a more concrete way of approaching this problem.

			<h2>Gathering Information: Interviews</h2>
			<p>Now that we have found our design problem, we have to find out more information about it. As a result, we decided to interview other students! <br><br>

			When I first looked at this assignment I was worried. As I still didn’t know that many people, and more importantly I didn’t know whom to interview. I thought that our target audience was freshmen, but we changed it to college students in general as this problem affects everyone. <br><br>

			The two people I interviewed was Ria Hu and Vivian Teng. I asked a variety of questions about my problem of college student’s unhealthy eating habits. I found out that there were a variety of reasons for their eating habits. <br><br>

			Both now live on campus as a result were our target audience. They told me that their parents mainly cooked for them at home, and now at college they don’t really know that many dishes. They do eat-out depending on factors like money, time, and convenience. <br><br>

			At the end of this interview I found several reasons why students have unhealthy eating habits. The reasons being lack of knowledge of dish recipes, time, money, and convenience.

			<h2>Team Communication</h2>
			<p>Now that we had assignments, we needed a medium to communicate in. Since we can’t work together in person all the time, we set up a Facebook group where we can communicate with one another. <br><br> 

			Inside this group we used the message function to ask questions with one another and post google docs. Inside these google docs we wrote our homework assignments together. This was very helpful to me as I am busy often, and as a result can be unavailable to meet up in person. Yet with this technology I am able to contribute to the design process anywhere.

			<h2>Ideation: 40 Ideas</h2>
			<p>Now that we have some ideas of what are the reasons behind unhealthy eating, we need to find prototypes that encompass these reasons. The task was to come up with 40 ideas to solve this problem. <br><br>

			It was at first difficult to come up with these ideas as I was drawing a blank without some help. As a result I searched on google on solutions to unhealthy eating habits. I found a great deal of results from both the technology and non-technology applications. <br><br>

			In the technology applications I found there were many apps that solve this issue. These apps solved this problem by using knowledge, money, time, distance, and other factors. For example, one app took a picture of an item which then revealed all the information pertaining to it like calorie amount. Another was a website where users uploaded pictures to a website where others rated the dish. <br><br>

			In the non-technological application there were results of real life help. There was advice like eating with other people or maintaining a set schedule. Also just eating healthy food like fruits and vegetable more often. <br><br>

			The difficult part was coming up with 20 original ideas. I came up with ideas that were similar to these ones. The original ideas that I did create were ridiculous like drinking water all day.  <br><br>

			At the end I found ideas on google that I liked. I liked certain themes and aspects and wanted to implement them in my prototype.

			<h2>Group: Making the Prototype</h2>
			<p>As a group we each came up with 40 ideas that solved our problem space. But making a prototype for each one would be impossible, so we decided to pick the top 3 ideas.

			We first started off by stating the inherent problems that students have that lead to unhealthy eating habits. The issues were money, time, convenience, and lack of knowledge. 

			In my 40 ideas there were two ideas that I found by searching by google. The two ideas were the picture of a dish app and the posting a picture for user feedback app. These two ideas seemed fun and could be changed to our discretion in making it solve any of the issues. The last idea we decided to go with was a money budget app in order to solve that issue of money.

			I decided to choose the uploading pics for feedback app. Wesley chose the money budget and Jenny chose the take a picture app. When making the prototype I decided to try to make it solve all the issues. I included various features that solved the money issue, time, and lack of knowledge. I clearly didn’t understand what I was trying to solve exactly.

			<h2>Low-Fidelity Prototype</h2>
			<p>In this assignment I had to test these prototypes with two users. The users that tested my prototype were Oscar Wong and James Prow. I prepared various tasks for the users to perform in order to see if the prototype can truly solve these issues. <br><br>

			Oscar and James generally performed the tasks fairly quickly for my prototype that dealt with user feedback. For example, when search for new recipes they found it easily. They also understood how to upload their own recipe easily as well. The main issues were the confusing layout and the meanings of various features. There were problems like confusion on how to message a user as the layout was confusing. <br><br>

			Next I tested the take a picture prototype. Which led to an immediate problem as they didn’t know how to start. The issue was that there was no home screen, as it was defaulted to the picture screen. But once they started they completed all the tasks quickly and found the information about the dishes interesting.

			<p>
			

			Last, I tested the money budget prototype. Both users completed the tasks easily, but Oscar did have a little trouble getting started. There were features that weren’t obvious to the user, such as the filter option. <br>

			All in all, I learned that whichever prototype we choose needs to be simple and have all the features be obvious. There is no point in adding features if the users don’t notice or know how to use them. However I thought that the user feedback prototype would be the most interesting as I thought most people would use it often as it is a social website.</p>

			<h2>Group Meeting: Scenarios and Changing the Prototype</h2>
			<p>In this meeting we discussed the results of our findings as well as make scenarios for our prototypes. At this meeting we had to choose one prototype of the 3 for our homework. We decided to use my prototype: the user feedback prototype. 

			Knowing the prototype, we made scenarios for its use. I learned that in these scenarios we really want to describe the person in detail as if they were real. We want to analyze their motivations of their actions as it pertains to our design.

			As in our first meeting we decided to make one scenario about the freshmen 15 scenario. More specifically how freshmen have to eat out inside the dorms due to having a dining plan. In addition to their circumstances of leaving home for the first time and not knowing how to cook which leads to them eating out.

			When making changes to the prototype like making it simpler, I kept the user of the scenarios in mind. This activity forced me to think of the user more in-depth when they interact with this website. As in what is there reason as to why they visited this site?

			<h2>Group: Preperation for next iteration</h2>
			<p>We met again to make our script for our prototype. We stuck with the same introduction, but added new tasks. Last time we only had a few tasks as we had to test other prototypes as well. Now that we can focus on this design, we aimed to find out as much information as possible.

			I designed these questions to find their reactions to certain features of the website. I wanted to know if the features could actually be applicable and if they are useful. For example, I wanted to see how long it would take them to find a recipe, which would fill the need for the lack of knowledge problem.

			4) If you wanted to add the famous ‘UW chicken soup’ recipe to your MyRecipe list, how would you do it?<br>
			5) If you wanted to upload the chicken soup dish you are about to eat, how would you do it?<br>
			6) If you wanted to find out what John Smith’s favorite dish is, how would you find out?<br>
			Are there any questions after performing these tasks?<br>
			Do you have any comments on the website as a whole?<br>

			<h2>Testing the improved version</h2>
			<p>This time I had to test only one prototype with two users. I tested the user feedback prototype with Oscar Wong and James Prow again. I listened to their feedback and made the design simpler and easier to use.

			In the newly prepared tasks I asked them to do, both completed them with little difficulty. However with little difficulty there were a few problems. While I did correct the errors in the first iteration like the message function, there were problems in the new features. I added the task of liking a dish in order to help make the healthiness of a dish clearer to a user. Both had problems with completing this task as the button was not intuitive, an up button. There were additional issues like the layout. There was too much information presented on the screen thus some features didn’t grab the attention of the user.

			When I first completed this prototype I thought I made a good one without any errors. I didn’t think to incorporate their suggestions to the new features we added to the website. I learned that I need to think about the user when doing any actions to the design. I can’t just follow their suggestions verbatim, but I have to understand why they said it and incorporate it into the design.

			<h2>Why is our site like this?</h2>
			<p>In this assignment we were told to explain our prototype and justify how it solves our problem space. I was in charge of the scope for this assignment. The scope is supposed to describe the overall goals of this website. 

			When writing this I thought long and hard what the point of our website was. There were features of time, money, and knowledge as well as social features. I couldn’t think of an overall theme so I just simply wrote what features were on the site and what weren’t.

			I didn’t really justify or explain the main point of this site well. As a result, I thought that we needed to look at our problem space again. The unhealthy eating habit space is too large thus we need a smaller one so that I can justify the site.

			<h2>Worried thoughts</h2>
			<p>This took place in class and the activity was to critique the visual of our prototypes. We found that there were various problems with the website. 

			I brought up the problem of confusing layout, and unclear purpose of certain features like the like button. As a result we decided to change a lot of things in our site. We decided to have a simpler layout in order to make the functionality of the site easier. We decided to get rid of some stuff like the picture icon, chat bubbles, and etc. We wanted to keep that theme throughout the whole web page. As a result we needed to keep features consistent throughout the site. For example the sizes of the images should be the same and the buttons used for the same features should be the same. 

			I was glad that as a team we could address the problems we found through our testing together. We are able to find a solution to the problems that will help our overall goal of providing information of healthy dish recipes to students.

			<h2>Confirmation of problems</h2>
			<p>We had now received feedback from our TA on the spec. He then confirmed my suspicions that our problem statement needs work and subsequently our scope.

			I then feeling worried pitched some problem statements to our TA and professor. I linked the problem to that students have difficulty gaining motivation to eat healthy. They said it could work if worded correctly. I found it interesting that they told me that the problem should be solvable. It should be introduced in a way that the reader naturally lands on the same conclusion, that it is a problem. 

			I changed the scope accordingly and justified how motivation was the reason for all the social features on the website. I also spoke with my teammates in changing the design of several of the pictures such as the like button. Not only changing, but also adding more content such as a page where the user can manage the site.

			I then read previous years’ design spec examples and followed some of their ideas. For example, sections like audience, more in-depth personas, and a conclusion. 

			At the end I felt more confident, yet still very worried, about the state of our specification. As we now had a clear statement, but it was new. I also felt that I had to force a lot of the features to relate it to motivation.

			<h2>Resolving issues</h2>
			<p>In this class were assigned a video to showcase our prototype. In this assignment I looked at our storyboard and found a problem with out problem statement. In the video we were acting out a normal usage of the site, but how would one show a user being motivated to using the site?

			As a result I thought this problem statement was faulty and thought a new one was in order. I told my partners that we should come up with a new one, and we decided to use the lack of knowledge on healthy dishes as our problem. This was perfect as it was the problem that all users that would use this site have, as they go onto this site to learn a dish.

			Afterwards, we showed the prototype without any issues in the video.

			<h2>Final Feedback</h2>
			<p>We turned in our design to our TA and professor for a preliminary grade. We gained some valuable feedback. Alex let us know that our changed problem statement was fine. However our rationale for our website was weak. In particular whenever we used Facebook as a source for why our features will work. 

			This was my fault, as I was in charge of turning in the Specifications to Alex. I wrote the rationale and thought that the Facebook model would be sufficient enough to explain why certain features would work. Features like chat, likes, etc. 

			As a result, I took the initiative and talked with my group about what final changes needed to be made before we turn in our final specification. We discussed changes like getting rid of chat, friends, etc as these features don’t really help solving our problem. In the end, we managed to make our site more specifically geared towards solving our problem of student’s lack of knowledge on healthy dishes.
